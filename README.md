To explore fossil fuels supply, demand, and usage - focusing on how largest fossil fuel consumer countries produce/ utilize coal, oil, gas and inspect if they really do have a high fossil fuel demand that they themselves can't fulfill.

Inspecting two main topics:

From (2), it was found that the gas production in these top 5 fossil fuel users/ producer countries is very low with some countries dropping to extreme low levels. To understand whether its the same condition on EU level, we do further analysis.
Understanding Russia's production and consumption of fossil fuels to compare it with Europe's to cross-check and understand Russia's influence and dependency on Europe for these fuels.
Twitter Sentiment analysis: captures what's being said about Europe energy and the crisis it's facing in 2022. Sentiment analysis helps in understading how the world feels about this by determining whether the sentiment conveyed in the tweets is positive, negative or neutral.

Investigating how Europe was moving more towards renewables and cleaner energy and how will it survive to move towards it faster despite tightening government budgets and the growing costs of some green technologies.

The motive lies in inspecting and analysing EU's past 20 years data to check if it'll take this crisis more as an opportunity to shift towards reducing carbon footprint as planned by European Green Deal or would it halt the roadmap to a cleaner energy future. From the analysis, I believe that Europeâ€™s energy crisis is a short-term blow to its transition away from fossil fuels.

The world lacks safe, low-carbon, and cheap large-scale energy alternatives to fossil fuels and I believe the same and it inspired me to take this as my topic. To analyse the entire world's data would've been unachievable given the time limitations and hence, I decided to analyse EU's energy data as Europe Energy Crisis is one of the biggest problem today.
